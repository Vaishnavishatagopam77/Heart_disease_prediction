# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains core machine learning model implementations written in Python and utilizing scikit-learn. It covers both classification and regression tasks, with complete workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Heart_disease_prediction
Implemented core ML models using scikit-learn: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Linear Regression, and Random Forest. Projects include data preprocessing, training, evaluation (accuracy, RÂ², RMSE), and visualization for both classification and regression tasks.


## Projects Included

### ðŸ“Œ Decision Tree Classifier
- Used for classification tasks
- Evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix
- Visualized using decision tree plots

### ðŸ“Œ Logistic Regression
- Applied for binary classification
- Performance checked with accuracy and a confusion matrix

### ðŸ“Œ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Implemented with multiple kernels (linear, RBF, etc.)
- Decision boundary visualization and accuracy comparison

### ðŸ“Œ Linear Regression
- Predicts continuous values (e.g., price, score)
- Evaluated with RMSE and RÂ² score

### ðŸ“Œ Random Forest Classifier
- Ensemble learning model using multiple decision trees
- Improved accuracy and feature importance analysis
